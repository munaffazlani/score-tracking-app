Ping Pong Game Score Tracking System :

How to run the project:

This project is a full MERN Stack project, it has backend api server in the current directory and it has frontend React js code inside of "./frontedn" directory.

install the server dependencies and run server by executing these commands in current dirctory.
npm i
npm run server

now install the frontend folder's dependencies and run frontend. To do that issue these commands.
cd frontend
npm i
npm start


NOTE: I have included .env file in the zip, ussualy we do not send .env file to git but for the easyness to run the project I have included that.
------------------------------------------

What changes will be required to use this application by millions of user daily?

1. Scalable Code Architecture :
- In order to make this application used by millions of users we would need to integrate many features and dependencies. Here highly scalable code architecture is must. As per your this question I already showcased a highly scalable architecture in frontend and backend code both.
- I used react-redux, redux-sagas, react testing library, localstorage and session storage to keep track of user data, highly componentized Ui, Integrated ES Lint, mongodb and mongoose with express js. I have followed very best practices of code. 

2. High end testing 
- We will have to do full proof testing of the product in three enviorment, development , staging and production.
- tests should include, unit testing, integration testing, end to end testing and automation testing for perfect user experience and minimal bugs and flaws in app. 

2. Scalable Infrastructure :

- We will need to use AWS services to make it scalable. We will need our api server to run on highly scalable Ec2 instance which can serve millions of api requests daily.
- We will need to host the website with CDN so users can have faster access. Cloudfront will be best choice for such thing.

3. Security & User management modules

- We need to use proper user authentication and user management module which includes, allowing user to save their data.

4. Better User Interface & features:

- That is obvious thing that we will need beter user interface and attractive featueres to gain and keep million users daily.
